# **Disaster Recovery Strategy**

This document outlines the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for the CI/CD infrastructure project. The goal of this strategy is to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime in the event of failures.

---

## **Objectives**

- **Minimize Downtime**: Ensure rapid recovery of critical services.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevent data loss by implementing robust backup mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the recovery process is adaptable to future changes in infrastructure.

## **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**

| Service        | RTO         | RPO        |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Jenkins Master | 1 hour      | 15 minutes |
| Worker Nodes   | 2 hours     | 30 minutes |
| Artifact Server| 1 hour      | 15 minutes |
| Monitoring     | 2 hours     | 30 minutes |

---

## **Backup Strategy**

1. **Jenkins Configuration and Data**
   - Frequency: Daily backups of configuration and build artifacts.
   - Tools: `backups/artifact-backup.sh` script.
   - Storage: S3 bucket with versioning enabled.

2. **Infrastructure State**
   - Frequency: After every significant change to infrastructure.
   - Tools: Terraform state files stored in a remote backend.

3. **Monitoring Logs**
   - Frequency: Continuous streaming to ELK stack.
   - Retention: 30 days in Elasticsearch.

## **Disaster Scenarios and Responses**

### **Scenario 1: Jenkins Master Failure**
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipelines are unavailable.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Restore the Jenkins master using the latest AMI or backup.
  2. Re-deploy missing configurations and pipelines.
  3. Reconnect worker nodes.

### **Scenario 2: Worker Node Failure**
- **Impact**: Build processes may be delayed or fail.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Spin up a new worker node using `install_worker.sh`.
  2. Update Jenkins to recognize the new worker.

### **Scenario 3: Data Loss in Artifact Server**
- **Impact**: Lost build artifacts.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Use `restore-artifacts.sh` to recover from backups.
  2. Verify artifact integrity.

### **Scenario 4: Monitoring Service Downtime**
- **Impact**: Inability to monitor logs or performance.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Restart the ELK stack services.
  2. Check Filebeat configurations and connectivity.

---

## **Infrastructure Failover**

1. **VPC and Network Configuration**
   - Maintain a secondary VPC in a different AWS region.
   - Use Terraform scripts to replicate network configurations.

2. **Database Replication**
   - Implement database replication for any persistent storage.

3. **DNS Failover**
   - Use Route 53 for automated DNS failover.

---

## **Testing the DR Plan**

- Conduct quarterly DR drills.
- Validate backup restoration for Jenkins, artifacts, and monitoring logs.
- Document lessons learned and improve the DR plan accordingly.

## **Roles and Responsibilities**

| Role              | Responsibility                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| DevOps Engineer    | Maintain backups, test DR procedures |
| Team Lead          | Approve DR drills and oversee recovery|
| Monitoring Team    | Ensure ELK stack availability        |

---

## **Tools and Resources**

- **AWS S3**: Backup storage.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure replication.
- **Bash Scripts**: Automated recovery tasks.
- **ELK Stack**: Log monitoring.

---

## **Conclusion**

This Disaster Recovery plan ensures rapid recovery from failures and provides a blueprint for maintaining system availability and integrity. Regular testing and updates to the plan will keep it effective as the infrastructure evolves.
